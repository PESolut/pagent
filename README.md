# Preme Agent — MVP Backend

This is the early-stage backend for the **Preme Agent** system. It currently serves as a minimal MVP to handle user sprint logging and trackable actions through what we call 'affirmations'.

## 🚀 Current Features

### ✅ Affirmations Controller
- Full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for affirmation entries.
- Data is stored in a **local database** (development mode).

### 🔁 Notion Webhook Integration
- **Webhook endpoint** receives payloads from Notion.
- Triggered when a new Sprint is added or when the **`Status`** field of an existing Sprint is updated in the Notion **Sprint database**.

### 🌐 Local Development with ngrok
- App is run locally on port **`3000`**.
- **ngrok** is used to expose the local server to the web so Notion can access the webhook endpoint.

#### Example:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```
The public URL generated by ngrok is added as the webhook target in Notion automation settings.
This allows real-time data transfer without deploying to a live server.

### 🧠 Next Steps
- Replace local DB with production-ready storage

- Build full Insight logging structure

- Extend webhook system to support more workflows

- Add frontend for real-time feedback and admin dashboard

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Node.js / Express
- ngrok for tunnel-based external access
- Local PSQL database (for now)

## 🧭 Planned Features (v1.0)

The Preme Agent v1.0 system is designed to be a fully operational command center for individual performance, productivity, and growth, deeply integrated with existing tooling and structured around principles of behavioral reinforcement and automated accountability.

### 🔹 Modular Sprint Engine
- Full support for creating, tracking, and managing sprint cycles
- Integration with Notion and JIRA for bi-directional task syncing
- Dynamic sprint statuses, velocity metrics, and timeline forecasts

### 🔹 Insight Logging Layer
- Persistent logging of all sprint and task events
- Webhook-based ingestion system with real-time payload auditing
- Centralized Insight Dashboard with filters by tag, user, sprint, and sentiment

### 🔹 Affirmation Protocol System
- Scheduled affirmation delivery via SMS, email, or in-app
- Intelligent selection based on context, tags, or performance history
- Personal library + team-shared affirmations (eventually)

### 🔹 DM Integration Layer (Phase 1: Instagram)
- Structured auto-response flows triggered by keywords or prompts
- Webhook-based triggers from Notion or Insight Logs
- Potential for habit-check-ins, sprint nudges, and momentum tracking

### 🔹 Admin Dashboard (Internal Use)
- View and manage all user sprints, affirmations, and logs
- Manual override controls, webhook replay, and user-level diagnostics

### 🔹 Token-Based Identity & Permissions
- Tiered access for users, collaborators, and system admins
- Future-proofing for subscription models, team views, and security boundaries
